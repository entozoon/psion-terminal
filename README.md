# Psion Terminal

- Rename this project to like.. lilygo terminal and include it in the larger terminal-bitch project.
- Turns out the lilygo library just [ripped off](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGo-EPD47) [this one](https://github.com/vroland/epdiy), so I'll try using that repo instead (it supports rotation..)
- There's a lilygo terminal example in fact!
- Battery level would be useful, from old code..
