# Psion Terminal

- Rename this project to like.. lilygo terminal and include it in the larger terminal-bitch project.
- Turns out the lilygo library just [ripped off](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGo-EPD47) [this one](https://github.com/vroland/epdiy), so it might be worth just pulling that repo instead? Don't have to decide just yet though
- Rotating.. there's the concept..
  `epd_set_rotation(EPD_ROT_INVERTED_LANDSCAPE);` but yeah it's not in the lilygo knockoff lib, fuck sake..
